# Creating a Lane Detection model using U-Net

TLDR; This was a project I built in January 2021. I have gotten an interest in self driving cars and wanted to build something with it. I used the focal tversky loss functions and the dice coefficient to train my model along with using the U-Net architecture. I have gotten dice scores of 0.9 after training my model for around 20 epochs and a focal loss score of around 0.15. I also put tested it in CARLAs simulator
