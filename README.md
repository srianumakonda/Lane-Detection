# Lane-Detection

Here's the colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tYP-AzMdP2nKdwwckKp0FGv9umL7gJBj?usp=sharing

The other python files are scripts that I uploaded to colab. Take a look at preprocess_data and model.

Note: project is not done yet. Model is training properly and is achieving accuracies > 98% but something that I'd like to try is to implement in my car along with the CARLA simulator :)
